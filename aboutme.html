      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <img src="images/chrisdecleeneprofile.jpg" alt="Chris DeCleene" class="me">
      <p>My name is Chris DeCleene. I am the owner of Credit Card Chris LLC. I am a Full Stack Engineer and SEO Manager out of Denver, CO. In this site, you will find a working history of my completed and existing projects and experiments. I specialize in JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and SEO.</p>
      <p>I have a less than traditional background for a programmer. I learned my skills through Codecademy's online certification course with additional self-learning through YouTube, Udemy, and lots of practice with projects for clients and on my own.</p>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts. I started with Techtronic Industries in June of 2015 as a field marketing specialist before moving into a Sales role with Milwaukee Tool (one of the brands under the Techtronic Industries umbrella). In July of 2017, I was promoted to a Channel Marketing position with Milwaukee Tool where I was highly involved with promotional systems and found a love for computers and algorithms.</p>
      <p>One of my main responsibilities was managing the Electronic Redemption program and website. It was in this role that I worked directly with a developer and his framework to deploy customer friendly promotional redemption sites.</p>
      <p>In August of 2020, I started my own sales organization under Credit Card Chris LLC. The focus of this organization is helping small businesses in the U.S. find affordable merchant services with top-end customer support.</p>
      <p>Now, I am operating under Credit Card Chris LLC to bring affordable and customizable web, point-of-sale and processing solutions. My mission is to make it easy for merchant to stay competitive in this modern landscape.</p>
